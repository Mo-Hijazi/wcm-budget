# Roadmap

Phase order and rationale. Backlog items live in `FUTURE_WORK.md`. Mark items ✓ here the moment they ship.

> **Vision:** grow beyond Cornell to all med students nationally.
> **Sequencing rationale:** 2.5 (UI) moved up from Phase 7 — polish before building more features. 2.5b (Auth) pulled forward from Phase 6 because Phase 3 needs real user profiles; building school-generalization on localStorage then migrating would be risky for existing users.

## Phase 1 ✓ — Core app
## Phase 2 ✓ — Savings & Charts (June 2026)
Projected graduation balance, recommendations, comparison mode, Step 3 goal + migration, pie chart month/range picker, CSV import (auto-detect columns, keyword categorization, review + bulk import).

## Phase 2.5 — Marro UI overhaul ✓ COMPLETE (June 11, 2026)
- ✓ Steps 1–3: palette/fonts/rename, growth-rings logo, glass cards site-wide + full UI audit
- ✓ Step 4 — Theme-ready tokens, neg/danger split, 3-tier glass, radius scale
- ✓ Step 5 — Neutral near-black dark theme; colorblind-safe blue/amber data pair
- ✓ Step 6 — Light theme + working toggle (prefers-color-scheme default, FOUC guard, sync-aware)
- ✓ Step 7 — Ring-derived custom icon system (categories + UI chrome)
- ✓ Step 8 — Identity embedding: rings app icon/favicon/manifest, ring loading screen, ring sync states, RingProgress goals, ring EmptyState
- ✓ Step 9 — De-Cornell visible copy + manifest (YEAR_CONFIGS data kept)
- ✓ Step 10 — Modal a11y (focus trap/Esc/aria), self-hosted fonts (offline-safe), mobile table edge fade, Step-fund chip states
- ✓ Step 11 — Blob health states (calm/low-tide/marigold bloom), docs rewritten
- Deferred from this phase → FUTURE_WORK: tab-pill redesign + cross-fades, chart gradient/draw-on animations, number-roll, apple-touch-icon PNG

## Phase 2.5b — Auth + Supabase ✓ COMPLETE (June 13, 2026)
- ✓ Google login via Supabase Auth; hard login gate (no anonymous mode), LoginScreen
- ✓ Supabase `app_state` table (one jsonb blob/user, RLS) replaces Gist as the sync transport; localStorage kept as offline cache + merge ancestor; 3-way merge engine reused unchanged (gistFetch/gistWrite → stateFetch/stateWrite); `api/sync.js` deleted
- ✓ First-login migration: uploads local state to Supabase if server row empty; `wcm_uid` shared-device guard
- ✓ `profiles` table + one-time ProfileModal: searchable picker over full Wikipedia-sourced US MD (LCME) + DO (COCA) lists (`US_MED_SCHOOLS`); multi-campus schools (LECOM, VCOM, PCOM, RVU, Indiana, Illinois, MSU, etc.) prompt a campus step, stored as "Name — Campus"; free-text Other; school shown in settings with a "Change" action that reopens the picker (editable/cancelable)
- Deferred to pre-public-launch (see FUTURE_WORK): custom auth domain + Google verification (consent screen currently shows raw Supabase domain + unverified warning; Testing mode capped at 100 users); remove unused `GIST_TOKEN` Vercel env var after a prod deploy.

## Phase 3 — School-agnostic generalization
First-run onboarding wizard, user-defined year configs, remove WCM hardcoding, variable program lengths. Required before any non-WCM users.

## Phase 4 — Claude AI financial advisor
Trigger-based (not a chatbot): passive monitoring, anomaly alerts, weekly digest, receipt scanning, goal-aware nudges. No autonomous writes. Cost strategy lives in memory (`project_wcm_ai_cost.md`).

## Phase 5 — Student loans tab
Loan entry by type, repayment simulator (Standard/IBR/PAYE/SAVE/Extended), PSLF modeling, residency projections. **Research before implementing — do not build from memory.**

## Phase 5b — Interview season budget
Cost planner by type (flights/hotels/clothes), specialty-aware estimates, integrates with main budget.

## Phase 5c — Specialty-specific financial outlook
Specialty pick → residency pay, fellowship likelihood, attending salary range, repayment trajectory, PSLF viability.

## Phase 6 — Multi-user backend & school benchmarking
School benchmarking (10+ users/school min), opt-in anonymized sharing, peer tips. Feeds Phase 4 quality.

## Phase 7 — Mobile & polish
Installable offline PWA, push notifications, PDF/CSV export, year-end summary, session timeout. (Deferred: terrarium mascot world — needs art pipeline.)

## Backlog
Residency transition planner, referral program, tax-relevant expense flagging.
